    "               the world have come and invaded us, captured our lands, conquered our minds. \n",

    "               the French, the Dutch, all of them came and looted us, took over what was ours. \n",
    "               Yet we have not done this to any other nation. We have not conquered anyone. \n",
    "               We have not grabbed their land, their culture, \n",
    "               their history and tried to enforce our way of life on them. \n",
    "               Why? Because we respect the freedom of others.That is why my \n",

    "               this in 1857, when we started the War of Independence. It is this freedom that\n",
    "               we must protect and nurture and build on. If we are not free, no one will respect us.\n",
    "               My second vision for India’s development. For fifty years we have been a developing nation.\n",
    "               It is time we see ourselves as a developed nation. We are among the top 5 nations of the world\n",
    "               in terms of GDP. We have a 10 percent growth rate in most areas. Our poverty levels are falling.\n",
    "               Our achievements are being globally recognised today. Yet we lack the self-confidence to\n",
    "               see ourselves as a developed nation, self-reliant and self-assured. Isn’t this incorrect?\n",
    "               I have a third vision. India must stand up to the world. Because I believe that unless India \n",
    "               stands up to the world, no one will respect us. Only strength respects strength. We must be \n",
    "               strong not only as a military power but also as an economic power. Both must go hand-in-hand. \n",
    "               My good fortune was to have worked with three great minds. Dr. Vikram Sarabhai of the Dept. of \n",

    "               I was lucky to have worked with all three of them closely and consider this the great opportunity of my life. \n",
